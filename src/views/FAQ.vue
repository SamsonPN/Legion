                            You can choose to auto-fill every character to a certain level, i.e. 
                            all level 200s or 250s or you can type in the level by their name. Eligible
                            legion characters are from 60-275.

                            The server can be slow sometimes and your preset might not be fetched correctly.
                            In this case, just refresh the page.

                    When I change my character's level in the Classes page, why doesn't the character's shape get 
                    updated on the grid?
                    <ol>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            The grid uses a preset list which houses the positions and informaton (coordinates, level, etc) of each character. These
                            coordinates help create the piece's shape on the board. When changing a character's level, these coordinates
                            <strong>ARE NOT CHANGED</strong> in the preset list, thus its shape is not updated.
                            </li>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            The way to fix this issue is to remove the piece from the grid by right clicking on its icon,
                            saving the preset, then refreshing the page.

                            This is a hexadecimal number that represents a color. Every 2 digits represents
                            the amount of red, green, or blue needed to create that color. For example, for a purely
                            red color, the code would be #FF0000 (all red, no green, no blue).

                    How does the grid work?
                    <ol>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            The grid is made up of two 2D matrices stacked on top of each other. The topmost
                            grid contains the legion pieces and is transparent while the bottom contains the 
                            stats and styling. The Assign button switches their orientation.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                    How does drag and drop work?
                    <ol>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            Initially, each piece would be inserted into a cell when placed on the grid. However, 
                            when the pieces were placed by the edges, some portions of it would be hanging off the grid.
                            What I decided to do instead was render the icon inside the cell and fill adjacent cells with 
                            the piece's color. This mimics the drag and drop behavior of the legion board but the actual
                            piece never moves from its container.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do the pieces work?
                    <ol>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            Similar to the grid, the pieces are a 5x5 2D matrix. Each character's icon is placed in the middle
                            at position (2, 2). Using a list of coordinates relative to the middle, I was able to recreate their shapes
                            according to their archetypes (warrior, magician, bowman, etc). 
                        </li>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            For example, an SSS rank Warrior would have these relative coordinates: (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0). 
                            For each coordinate, just add the middle position with these coordinates so (2, 2) + (1, 0) = (3, 0) to get
                            the adjacent cell position.
                        </li>

                    How do the rotations work?
                    <ol>
                        <li class="sublist">
                            The pieces rotate with respect to the middle icon. Thanks to the list of relative coordinates,
                            rotating the pieces was quite easy. Depending on the rotation, all I had to do was recalculate the coordinates
                            and color the new adjacent cell positions in.
